# Sales-Analysis-of-Mobile-Gadget
About This Project
I analysed a mobile gadget sales dataset to understand trends in customer purchases and product performance. Using Excel, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) with pivot tables and charts to uncover patterns in sales by brand, model, and region. The goal was to identify top-performing products and key drivers behind high and low sales.

What I Used
Excel
Pivot Tables
Conditional Formatting
Data Cleaning

What I Found
•	Certain brands consistently outperformed others across regions.
•	Mid-range models had the highest sales volume.
•	Repeat purchases and regional demand played a big role in revenue.
•	Some product lines performed poorly in specific areas, indicating scope for improvement.
