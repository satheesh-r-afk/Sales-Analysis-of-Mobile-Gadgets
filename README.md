About This Project
I analyzed a mobile gadget sales dataset to understand trends in customer purchases and product performance. Using Excel, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) with pivot tables and charts to uncover patterns in sales by brand, model, and region. The goal was to identify top-performing products and key drivers behind high and low sales.

What I Used
Excel

Pivot Tables

Conditional Formatting

Data Cleaning

What I Found
Certain brands consistently outperformed others across regions.

Mid-range models had the highest sales volume.

Repeat purchases and regional demand played a big role in revenue.

Some product lines performed poorly in specific areas, indicating scope for improvement.
